# A small personal page based on the Hydejack Jekyll Theme

I developed my page locally using the Jekyll dev container from Microsoft: mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/ruby:2.

Deployment on github pages via github actions.

All pictures are my own. Certificates are from acclaim.com, scrum.org and udemy.
