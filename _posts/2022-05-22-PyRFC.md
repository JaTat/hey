  Set up and run a remote function call on a BW system with pyRFC

Hey there! It can be hard as a Data Scientist in a BI organization that uses SAP BW as the main data warehouse technology. All these hard earned python skills are useless when your data is locked up under a layer of application written in ABAP, SAP's proprietary language. 
Imagine you could run ABAP modules from python, read and write into tables or execute functionality. This is possible with [pyRFC](https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC), a python library that works as an API to SAP's Netweaver Remote Function Call Software Development Kit (NWRFC SDK). The SDK allows developers to build programs that can call or can be called from ABAP software.



# Prerequisites
- SAP RFC SDK 7.5
- SAP GUI for Windows, needed for systems with Single Sign on enabled 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Cython](https://cython.org/) - Pythons C extension, required since the SDK is a C/C++ interface

To download the SDK you need a SAP customer account that is usually tied to a license. The download link can be found in SAP Note 2573790, follow the link [here](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/nwrfcsdk.html). Make sure to choose the right operating system under downloads, the dropdown is a little tricky to find.

# Install SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK 7.50

## Windows
Installation is straight forward you only have to create an env variable and extend the path.
Env variables under windows are set permanently (written to registry) with ```setx <variable>```. You need to restart the shell after executing. 
Or you can use the GUI under advanced system settings --> environment variables. Choose if you want to change the variables system wide or only for your user.

# Ubuntu

Note: I run Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Both python-dev and the python library Cython are a prerequisite to install from source. I install python dev with ubuntu's package manager apt and Cython with pip.


I follow the documentation on [SAP github](https://sap.github.io/PyRFC/) to install the SDK.

In bash I create a new directory  ```mkdir /usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk```. Then I set the SAPNWRFC_HOME env variable to that directory with ```export SAPNWRFC_HOME=/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk```. To make sure that worked I run ```echo $SAPNWRFC_HOME ```. Next I copy the downloaded SDK into that directory and unzip it with  ``` unzip /usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/nwrfc750P_9-70002752.zip ```. I move the contents of the newly created folder to its parent folder and delete the now empty nwrfcsdk folder. 
So that python can find the libraries its important to create necessary system links. For this I add the lib folder to the path variable with ```export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib ```.

To update the shared libraries links and cache I follow the documentation and create a config file in /etc/ld.so.conf.d. As root:  ```vi /etc/ld.so.conf.d/nwrfcsdk.conf```. And in the file I add:


```Shell
# include nwrfcsdk
/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib
```

Now as root: ```ldconfig``` and to check if the libraries were linked ```ldconfig -p | grep sap``` should show the libraries from ```/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib```

# Install pyRFC
Get the latest release from GitHub by checking the [release page](https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC/releases). At the time of writing the latest release is v2.5.0.. Installing pyRFC on Linux required me to build it from source. So I get the Source code archive with ```git clone  https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC``` cd into the cloned directory and run ```python3 setup.py bdist_wheel```. This should also work on Windows although here I was able to pip install the wheel I got from [here](https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC/releases/tag/v2.5.0)

To check that the installation is working, I run from python:

```python
from pyRFC import *
```
It returns nothing so I am good to go.

# Python class to read tables from a BW

The class implementation is inspired by a blog post from [lwrc](https://startup.lwmeta.com/2020/06/09/connecting-python-with-sap-step-by-step-guide/). 

It calls **RowsAtATime** per batch and iterates as long as the result is larger than **RowsAtATime**.

In my experience it is safe to set **RowsAtATime** to ~1000.

Other important parameter are:

- Fields: Allows you to specify fields as a list, the RFC module fails silently and returns no data when field is not present in table
- TableName: Specify name of table you want to call, check e.g. via Link
Where: Specify a where condition, sensitive to spaces around =
- RowsAtATime: The number of rows you want to transfer per iteration/ batch, smaller batches might be safer but take longer
- RowSkips: Nr. of rows to skip from the beginning of the table

Note that you can check the parameters of RFC modules with SAP transaction SE37.

```python
from pyrfc import Connection, ABAPApplicationError, ABAPRuntimeError, LogonError, CommunicationError

            self.conn = Connection( **params_connection)
            
        except CommunicationError:

              RowSkips += RowsAtATime

              for line in range(0, len(result['ET_DATA'])):
                  #only append list to list not the returned dictionary
                  l_result.append(result['ET_DATA'][line]["LINE"].strip())

              headers =  headers = [x['FIELDNAME'] for x in result['FIELDS']]  
              if len(result['ET_DATA']) < RowsAtATime:
                  break
          l_result = [x.strip().split('|') for x in l_result ]
          df = pd.DataFrame(l_result, columns=headers)
      except (ABAPApplicationError, ABAPRuntimeError):
          print("An error occurred.")
          raise

        # self.logger.info( "Download time - {0} download took --- {1} seconds ---".format(TableName,datetime.datetime.now()- start_time ))
