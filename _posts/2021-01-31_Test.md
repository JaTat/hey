## What is BW/4 anyways?
SAP BW/4 Hana is often used by larger enterprises as an analytical Data Warehouse. Since the BW application has been around since 1998, it comes with its own vocabulary, learning ressources and legions of experts. 
BW/4 is SAP's packages Business Warehouse application running on SAP's proprietary columnar in-memory HANA database. It provides a Data Management ecosystem with just about everything you need to build and run a enterprise grade Datawarehouse. It is built on SAP's proprietary technology stack SAP Netweaver which in turn is built mainly on SAP's own programming language ABAP.
